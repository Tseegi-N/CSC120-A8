Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
Agency represents a talent agency that represent and manage artists. Each method in the class shows different everyday tasks that such agencies face. For example, grab() method is how talent divisions in agencies find new acts and sign them under the agency while fly() method shows purchasing plane tickets based on class seats. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I've had one overload method with shrink() because I wanted to decrease their ranking by a given amount and see differences it'd make in walk() methods where they had to reference the ranking of the star. It would have run more smoothly and easier if I had put the values in a hashtable and assigned the name and ranking but it meant I had to change major parts of my coding and since it's the time of the semester when everyone's busy, I've decided to keep it as it is. But I know how to do it as library class used it for last assignment. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Spent a lot of time trying to come up with methods that correspond with the name. To be precise, the method examine() was hard to apply to my class because what does a star/agency exam? Instead I took a different approach and just focused on the star and how their health might impact other parts of their star quality. I think all is good and fun if you have more time and just let your mind explore the different possibilities that this assignment provides.
